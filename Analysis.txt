1. Task0.py 
Worst Case Big-O Notation: O(1)
Analysis: No matter how big the list is, first and last records can be fetched in constant time


2. Task1.py
Worst Case Big-O Notation: O(n)
Analysis: Two lists (calls and texts) are looped through once each. O(2n) -> O(n)


3. Task2.py
Worst Case Big-O Notation: O(n + m)
Analysis: List is (calls) looped through once then max of the phone call duration is returned. O(n + m) -> O(n)


4. Task3.py
Worst Case Big-O Notation: O(n + m + nlogn) 
Analysis: List is looped through once for filter then looped to get codes_dict
    then sorted codes_dict is returned O(n + m + nlogn)-> O(nlogn)


5. Task4.py
(Worst Case Big-O Notation: O(n + m + nlogn)
Analysis: Two lists are looped through once and then combined in sorted set O(n + m + nlogn) -> O(nlogn)
